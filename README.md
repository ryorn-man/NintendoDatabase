# Nintendo Database

## Overview
The Nintendo Database collects data and displays information about entities related to Nintendo. It consists of a database running on mySQL, and a PHP website with an encyclopedia design. The database contains entities related to Nintendo, as well as articles and other content displayed on the website. The site is similar to a wiki, but much simpler to design; there is no need to program functions for editing, logging in, adding and deleting pages, or all that other user-centric stuff that makes a wiki a wiki.

The main purpose of the Nintendo Database is to inform users about the company Nintendo. It provides information on products, services, the timeline of the company, people working at Nintendo, and other relevant details, as identified in the paragraph below.

There are two general categories of database entities: entities related to Nintendo, and website content for users to read. The first category consists of video games, consoles, franchises, magazines, toys, mobile devices, historical events in the company timeline, services offered by Nintendo, subsidiaries and business partners, and staff members working at Nintendo or associated companies. The second category includes articles and images.


The user interface of the website is simple and minimalistic, to make for an easy reading experience. There is a header with a logo, navigation menu, and (if time allows) a search bar. Articles reside in the page body, with a sidebar for links to header elements. There are references for information at the end of each article. There are description boxes for games, consoles, magazines, etc. which draw information from the database.

 Many resources can provide information to aid this project. There are many pieces of free and open-source software available for creating wikis, such as MediaWiki (used by Wikipedia), Wiki.js, PHP Wiki, and Nuclino. While the Nintendo Database is not a wiki, the design and source code of these projects may offer clues for how to structure the site and handle internal linking. Wikis typically store their articles in a database. There is also a massive amount of information available online about Nintendo.
 
It should be possible to complete this project in three months.
